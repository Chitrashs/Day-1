Write a blog about objects and its internal representaions in Javascript

1. Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
2. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types
  Number, 
  String, 
  Boolean, 
  null, 
  undefined and 
  symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).

3. Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
4. An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
5. A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. 
Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects.
6. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation
Properties of JavaScript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation (for more details see property accessors). 
Objects are sometimes called associative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value that can be used to access it
